#QFT

Banking and financial services firms rely on a variety of complex numerical and computational models to generate point in time analytics and forecast measures. These tools are often developed in analytical programming languages such as Python, R, Matlab, etc., and are used by the traders, portfolio managers, and risk managers to generate quantitative insights to support their day to day business activities.
The mentor for this project is Arpit Narain (​http://linkedin.com/in/arpit-narain-cfa -frm-cqf​)9. Arpit is the global head of financial solutions at MathWorks. He is responsible for the global expansion of the firm's financial services business in the areas of quantitative modeling and AI / Machine Learning. He has 12 years of experience in the quantitative finance domain working with consulting firms, risk product development firms, and investment banks.. He has a personal relationship with Aman and Mr. Narain has given us this project.
We will be implementing a quantitative finance tool that can do pricing, risk analytics, and forecasting of financial instruments. The tool will be implemented with Python and multiple analytics packages. Our first assignment is working with fixed rate bonds and creating functions that can determine the value of these bonds in the present and future. Later, we will be working with floating rate bonds, derivatives, possibly stocks/shares and creating tools for risk management and forecasting.
